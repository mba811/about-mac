# RubyGems

[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/), the Ruby package manager, was also installed:

    $ which gem

Update to its latest version with:

    $ gem update --system

To install a "gem" (Ruby package), run:

    $ gem install <gemname>

To install without generating the documentation for each gem (faster):

    $ gem install <gemname> --no-document

To see what gems you have installed:

    $ gem list

To check if any installed gems are outdated:

    $ gem outdated

To update all gems or a particular gem:

    $ gem update [<gemname>]

RubyGems keeps old versions of gems, so feel free to do come cleaning after updating:

    $ gem cleanup

We mainly use Ruby for the CSS pre-processor [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), which is built on top of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/):

    $ gem install compass --no-document
