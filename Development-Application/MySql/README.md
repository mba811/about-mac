# MySQL

### Install

We will install [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) using Homebrew, which will also install some header files needed for MySQL bindings in different programming languages (MySQL-Python for one).

To install, run:

    $ brew update # Always good to do
    $ brew install mysql

As you can see in the ouput from Homebrew, before we can use MySQL we first need to set it up with:

    $ unset TMPDIR
    $ mkdir /usr/local/var
    $ mysql_install_db --verbose --user=`whoami` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp

### Usage

To start the MySQL server, use the `mysql.server` tool:

    $ mysql.server start

To stop it when you are done, run:

    $ mysql.server stop

You can see the different commands available for `mysql.server` with:

    $ mysql.server --help

To connect with the command-line client, run:

    $ mysql -uroot

(Use `exit` to quit the MySQL shell.)

**Note**: By default, the MySQL user `root` has no password. It doesn't really matter for a local development database. If you wish to change it though, you can use `$ mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'`.
